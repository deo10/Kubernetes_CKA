Sure, here are the answers to the questions about Helm:

1. **What is Helm and why is it used in Kubernetes?**
   - Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications. It simplifies the deployment process by allowing you to package Kubernetes resources into a single Helm chart, which can be versioned and shared.

2. **What is a Helm chart?**
   - A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. It includes templates, configuration files, and metadata that define how to deploy and manage an application on a Kubernetes cluster.

3. **How do you install a Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster?**
   - You can install a Helm chart using the `helm install` command. For example:
     ```sh
     helm install my-release my-chart
     ```
     This command installs the chart named `my-chart` with the release name `my-release`.

4. **What is the purpose of the `values.yaml` file in a Helm chart?**
   - The `values.yaml` file contains default configuration values for the Helm chart. It allows you to customize the deployment by specifying values for the chart's templates. Users can override these values during installation or upgrade.

5. **How do you override default values in a Helm chart during installation?**
   - You can override default values by using the `--set` flag or by providing a custom values file with the `-f` flag. For example:
     ```sh
     helm install my-release my-chart --set key1=value1,key2=value2
     ```
     or
     ```sh
     helm install my-release my-chart -f custom-values.yaml
     ```

6. **What command would you use to list all the releases installed by Helm in a Kubernetes cluster?**
   - You can list all the releases installed by Helm using the `helm list` command:
     ```sh
     helm list
     ```

7. **How do you upgrade an existing Helm release?**
   - You can upgrade an existing Helm release using the `helm upgrade` command. For example:
     ```sh
     helm upgrade my-release my-chart
     ```
     This command upgrades the release named `my-release` with the new version of the chart `my-chart`.

8. **What is the difference between `helm install` and `helm upgrade`?**
   - `helm install` is used to install a new Helm chart as a release in the Kubernetes cluster. `helm upgrade` is used to upgrade an existing release with a new version of the chart or new configuration values.

9. **How can you rollback a Helm release to a previous version?**
   - You can rollback a Helm release to a previous version using the `helm rollback` command. For example:
     ```sh
     helm rollback my-release 1
     ```
     This command rolls back the release named `my-release` to revision 1.

10. **What is a Helm repository and how do you add one to your Helm client?**
    - A Helm repository is a collection of Helm charts that are stored in a remote or local location. You can add a Helm repository to your Helm client using the `helm repo add` command. For example:
      ```sh
      helm repo add my-repo https://example.com/charts
      ```
      This command adds the repository named `my-repo` with the URL `https://example.com/charts` to your Helm client.
