\\Backup
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot --cacert="" --cert="" --endpoints=[127.0.0.1:2379] --key="" filepath/filename.db

\\Restore
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

\\In this case, we are restoring the snapshot to a different directory
but in the same server where we took the backup (the controlplane node)
As a result, the only required option for the restore command is the --data-dir.

\\update the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
We have now restored the etcd snapshot to a new path on the controlplane - /var/lib/etcd-from-backup, so, the only change to be made in the YAML file, is to change the hostPath for the volume called etcd-data from old directory (/var/lib/etcd) to the new directory (/var/lib/etcd-from-backup).

  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data

\\With this change, /var/lib/etcd on the container points to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup on the
controlplane (which is what we want).
When this file is updated, the ETCD pod is automatically re-created as this is a static pod
placed under the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.
If you do change --data-dir to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup in the ETCD YAML file,
make sure that the volumeMounts for etcd-data is updated as well, with the mountPath pointing
to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
